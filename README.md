This repository includes the following graduate research/course projects I worked on my own.
### SPLC_network: 
In this project (2018-2019), I extracted firm-level supply chain data from the Bloomberge Terminal (**Source Code.xlsx**), and applied a network analysis approach **Social_Netowrk_Final.R** to study how the global supply chain has changes in automobile and electric industries. I presented a feasibility report **SPLC_Report.pdf** to my Chinese colleagues.

### Semantic_Modeling_Think_Tank:
This is the final project for *Computational Content Analysis*.  
Historically, the conservatism in the U.S. is a mixture of three strands: economic conservatism, traditionalist conservatism, and anti-communism (Busch 2011). Economic conservatives, or libertarians,
promote liberty, small government, and free-market principles. Traditionalist conservatives, or social conservatives, oppose to certain changes in social norms and seek for the preservation of conventional family and religious values. Anti-communist conservatives, with less commitment to domestic issues, have evolved into the so-called foreign policy conservatives within the modern Republican Party, with an emphasis on national defense and national security affairs.  
Despite this ideological faction, current quantitative measures tend to analyze individuals and organizations on a bi-polar spectrum of left and right. I argue that to better understand political polarization, it is important to capture the nuances in how ideologies are interpreted and framed differently and how these differences themselves lead to political consequences. I start by discussing how modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) may help us capture the change in conservative think tank strategies. I will then examine the implications and limitations of these approaches from a processual perspective and propose directions for future research.  

* **data_processing**: I present how I web-scraped think tank websites and preprocessed the scraped articles.
* **analysis_visualization**: I examine 1) the language shift by word frequency and 2) used topic modeling (Doc2Vec and Word2Vec) and Part-of-Speach (POS) analysis to study think tanks' framing strategies.
* **Final_Paper.pdf**: I used the quantitative result of this research as part of my final paper for *Seminar: Social Process*, in which I discuss both the limits and advantages of using natural language processing to understand policy framing strategies from a processual perspective.
