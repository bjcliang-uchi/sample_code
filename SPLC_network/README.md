### SPLC_network: 
In this project (2018-2019), I extracted firm-level supply chain data from the Bloomberge Terminal (**Source Code.xlsx**), and applied a network analysis approach **Social_Netowrk_Final.R** to study how the global supply chain has changes in automobile and electric industries. I presented a feasibility report **SPLC_Report.pdf** to my Chinese colleagues.
